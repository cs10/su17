    <h2 id="where-did-you-grow-up-what-was-your-path-to-cal">WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?</h2>

<p>I am a local kid – I grew up moving around various places throughout
the East Bay (Hercules, Vallejo, San Pablo, Richmond, and back to
Hercules). I spent many weekends in the shadow of the university
visiting my grandmother at work at Alta Bates Medical Center a few
blocks away from the school. When I got bored I would walk down
Telegraph Ave. and spend my afternoon at Amoeba and Rasputin’s, looking
for used ’90s rock and indie CDs. I didn’t plan to go to Berkeley in high
school; it was too close to home, but it ended up being my choice.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-programming-have-you-done--what-languages">HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (&amp; WHAT LANGUAGES)?</h2>

<p>I began with Snap! (I had no programming experience throughout all of
grade school). Since then, I learned Python, Scheme, Java, C, and some
C++.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-hobbies">WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?</h2>

<p>Recently I have been watching a lot more college football. I love good television 
– I grew up on StarTrek: The Next Generation (which subsequently indoctrinated 
me with a humanist disposition), and enjoy fantasy, science fiction, and drama. I 
used to write a lot of poetry and some short fiction, which I lost the knack for 
when I entered college. Recently I am trying to get back into a groove with that.
When I am at home and I am stressed I break out my electric guitar and play
(poorly). I also love discussing politics and philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="what-commitments-will-be-consuming-your-cycles-this-semester">WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?</h2>

<p>This semester, I am taking Operating Systems, Human Reproduction, and Conflict
Management. I am also working as a student assistant at the Center for Long-Term
Cybersecurity. I am currently working on a paper on Brexit and its possible effects
on EU cybersecurity policy and am busy trying to figure out what I’m writing for a
senior thesis.</p>
