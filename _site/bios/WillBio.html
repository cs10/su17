    <h2 id="where-did-you-grow-up-what-was-your-path-to-cal">Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal?</h2>

<p>I was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin up until the 2nd grade, at which point my family made a drastic cross-country move to the tiny desert town of Yuma, Arizona. I stayed there until 6th grade before moving to the agricultural suburbs of Fresno, California, where I attended Clovis West High School. When it came down to it, I was deciding between Cal, Duke University, and Carnegie Mellon, and ultimately Cal was the best choice for educational (and financial) reasons.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-programming-have-you-done--what-languages">How much programming have you done (&amp; what languages)?</h2>

<p>I actually came into Cal as a purely Pre-Haas (Intended Business Administration) major. But after an incredible experience in CS 10 and the intense peer pressure of my friends, I decided to sacrifice my sanity and sleep, taking on a dual degree in Business Administration and Computer Science. So far, Iâ€™ve programmed in Python, Java, C, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and of course, Snap!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-hobbies">What are your hobbies?</h2>

<p>Tennis, basketball, late-night movies / eating, and perusing sports news or the WSJ</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-of-your-talents--skills">What are some of your talents &amp; skills?</h2>

<p>Growing up, I practiced Kenpo Karate for several years. I also was an avid thumb-wrestler back in the day.</p>

<h2 id="have-you-done-anything-remarkable-has-anything-memorable-happened-to-you">Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?</h2>

<p>In middle school, I created a small unofficial, commercial for Barnes &amp; Noble that required me to speak in a British accent. It ended up winning an award in a film festival despite its poor quality. I also occasionally give talks on campus on the intersection of science and faith.</p>

<h2 id="what-commitments-will-be-consuming-your-cycles-this-semester">What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?</h2>

<p>Business &amp; CS classes, teaching, research, church, and avid eating.</p>
