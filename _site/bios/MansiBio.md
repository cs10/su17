## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Fremont, California (the last stop on Bart)! I knew I wanted to stay local for college, so Cal ended up being a great choice for me.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I’d never programmed before coming to Cal, so my first exposure to computer science was actually in CS10! Since then, I’ve taken a computer science class every semester, and I’ve programmed in Snap!, python, Java, and R.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I really enjoy learning new things, watching TV, and singing (though I’m not very good at it).

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
My classes (CS70, Stat 134, Stat 133, Data 8), teaching CS10, research, and some awesome clubs :)
