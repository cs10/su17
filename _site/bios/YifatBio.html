    <h2 id="where-did-you-grow-up-what-was-your-path-to-cal">WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?</h2>

<p>I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. My parents and I moved to San
Jose, CA, when I was about three years old. I grew up in San
Jose and came to Cal in 2013!</p>

<h2 id="how-much-programming-have-you-done--what-languages">HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (&amp; WHAT LANGUAGES)?</h2>

<p>My first ever experience programming was in CS10. There, I
learned Snap! and a bit of python, and fell in love with computer
science. Since then, I switched over to the CS major and have
taken some more CS courses. For the most part, I’ve worked with
Snap!, python, java, C, and Groovy. I think it’s fun to learn
new programming languages—in many ways it is not too different
from learning new spoken languages! It’s all about expressing 
the same things but in different ways.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-hobbies">WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?</h2>

<p>I enjoy yoga and hiking and traveling and camping and dancing
and my little sister and cooking and friendship.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-of-your-talents--skills">WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS &amp; SKILLS?</h2>

<p>My first language is Hebrew! I speak Hebrish (an English-Hebrew hybrid)
at home with my family. I also know a bit of Spanish, as I learned
it for six years in school and have a friend in Spain who I
visit occasionally.</p>

<h2 id="have-you-done-anything-remarkable-has-anything-memorable-happened-to-you">HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?</h2>

<p>I ran my first half marathon last semester! #BerkeleyHalf2016</p>

<h2 id="what-commitments-will-be-consuming-your-cycles-this-semester">WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?</h2>

<p>Machine Learning, Discrete Optimization, Wealth and Poverty, African Music Ensemble, teaching CS10, applying for the 5th year masters program, yoga PE, and enjoying my final semester at UC Berkeley (as an undergrad, at least)!</p>
