    <h2 id="where-did-you-grow-up-what-was-your-path-to-cal">WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?</h2>

<p>I grew up in Orinda, CA (over the hills/through the Caldecott Tunnel)
 so I’m born and bred from the East Bay. I did not intend to come to Cal,
  but then I did… ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<h2 id="how-much-programming-have-you-done--what-languages">HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (&amp; WHAT LANGUAGES)?</h2>

<p>Technically, in 7th grade I created my a website using HTML (it was on Broadway
 musicals); but at the time didn’t realize that was programming…so I don’t
 really count it. That aside, I didn’t take up computer science until CS10,
 learning BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks, the previous iteration of Snap!).
 After that there’s been a hodgepodge of Python, Java, C, MIPS, Ruby, etc.
 throughout these four and a half years (most of which I have not retained as
 well as I probably should). This will be the first semester I am not taking a
 CS class, so no programming for me this fall.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-hobbies">WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?</h2>

<p>I like reading, occasionally writing, napping, and cuddling with dogs (but in
 reality, mostly it’s staring at dogs from afar so as to not creep out the owner).</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-of-your-talents--skills">WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS &amp; SKILLS?</h2>

<p>I can make a clover with my tongue, I memorize Broadway musicals pretty
well, and I listen well?</p>

<h2 id="have-you-done-anything-remarkable-has-anything-memorable-happened-to-you">HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?</h2>

<p>I finished writing two novels in 6th and 7th grade, and then I walked part
of the Great Wall of China in 8th. I kind of peaked early.</p>

<h2 id="what-commitments-will-be-consuming-your-cycles-this-semester">WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?</h2>

<p>Classes, answering emails, and worrying about that real life that I will
have to face come December.</p>
