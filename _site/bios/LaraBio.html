    <h2 id="where-did-you-grow-up-what-was-your-path-to-cal">WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?</h2>

<p>I grew up in Chino Hills, a suburb in Southern California about 1 hour east of Los Angeles. I went to International Polytechnic High School (the name is fancy, but the school is not) a small college prep High School on the campus of Cal-Poly Pomona. There I was able to take college classes in High School. I applied to a lot of UCs as I planned to stay in California and ended up getting into CAL!</p>

<h2 id="how-much-programming-have-you-done--what-languages">HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (&amp; WHAT LANGUAGES)?</h2>

<p>I came into Berkeley intending to major in Linguistics and had no prior programming experience. CS10 was the first class I took here at CAL. I fell in love with the course and Computer Science. I am now a double majoring Linguistics and Computer Science. I have programmed in Snap!, python, java, C and some other languages. My favorite Language is Snap!</p>

<p>I’m a member of Cal Wushu and have been doing Wushu since I was about 7 years old. However, I haven’t competed since graduating from High School. I also like to dance and am  part of [M]ovement a dance organization on campus.</p>

<h2 id="have-you-done-anything-remarkable-has-anything-memorable-happened-to-you">HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?</h2>

<p>In Taiwan a monkey once slapped my leg so hard it gave me a bruise.</p>
