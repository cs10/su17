    <h2 id="where-did-you-grow-up-what-was-your-path-to-cal">WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?</h2>

<p>I was born in San Diego, CA, quickly moved out to Boise, Idaho and
eventually ended up growing up in the same neighborhood my parents
grew up in: Fair Oaks, CA.  Fair Oaks is a small suburb of Sacramento,
CA, with some of the best scenery you can possibly imagine (I’m a bit
biased, what can I say!).  I went to Bella Vista High School and eventually
made the best decision to attend Cal in Spring 2013.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-programming-have-you-done--what-languages">HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (&amp; WHAT LANGUAGES)?</h2>

<p>Coming out of high school, I had zero background in programming and Computer
Science in general.  However, I took CS10 my first semester, and fell in love
with BYOB (the precursor language to Snap!).  However, since taking CS10,
I now have since learned and worked with Python, Java, YAML, C, HTML, and
UNIX.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-hobbies">WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?</h2>

<p>I like running! I did Cross Country and Track &amp; Field in High School,
so I am always down for exploring new trails and awesome parks.  However,
beyond running, I am also a bit of a gamer.  I play all sorts of video games,
so feel free to ask me what I am into these days!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-of-your-talents--skills">WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS &amp; SKILLS?</h2>

<p>I don’t really have any cool talents or skills to note. However, you can
test my music knowledge! I am an avid consumer of all types of music, so
I have become well-versed in the history and the study of Ethnomusicology.
This is partially why I have also decided to Minor in Music here at Cal.</p>

<h2 id="have-you-done-anything-remarkable-has-anything-memorable-happened-to-you">HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?</h2>

<p>In High School, I was a member of our school’s Academic Decathlon team.
If you haven’t heard of “Aca Deca,” it is a competition composing of ten
different “events” that span practically every possible field of Academics
you can think of.  I ended up receiving the Gold Medal in the Speech category
at both the Sacramento County and California State compeitions for a speech
I wrote and performed about my experience with running in High School and following
in my father’s footsteps.  It’s a bit of a personal story, but I’m sure my speech
is out there somewhere on the internet for you to consume!</p>

<h2 id="what-commitments-will-be-consuming-your-cycles-this-semester">WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?</h2>

<p>Beyond serving as a Head TA for CS10, I am a member of a social fraternity,
Alpha Sigma Phi, and I hold a couple of different positions within our
organization.  I also am a full-time student at Cal finishing up my last
semester(!!).</p>
