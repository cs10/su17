# [CS10 Summer 2017 üå¥‚õ±üèäüèæ][site]

[site]: http://cs10.org/su17

## Getting Started
This site is built with Jekyll. To build the site, you need Jekyll and Ruby installed. Github has some fairly straight forward instructions, here:
https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/

To get the site, run

`git clone https://github.com/cs10/su17.git`

It may take a while.

## Updating the Website

Stay up to date before you make changes with by running

```
git pull origin gh-pages
git submodule update
```

The 'submodule update' part refers to the folder `resources`. That folder is actually another git repository, shared by all cs10 sites.

To preview the site you should run:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

The most common file to edit will be `includes/summer_calendar.html` which holds an HTML table with the calendar in it. Ctrl-f to find the part of the table you need to edit.

To update staff photos, or anything in the `resources` submodule, first run `git submodule update`. Then you may make changes directly in the `resources` folder. To push the changes, `cd` into `resources`, and run:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
git push origin gh-pages
cd ..
git add resources
git commit -m "update resources tree"
git push origin gh-pages
```

What this does is update the resources repository, then tell the su17 repository to point to the newest version of the resources repository.

Some other things:
* lectures should link to the lecture folder in Drive.
* discussion resources should go in `discussion/`

## Web Dependencies

* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* FullCalendarJS -- for the Google Calendar schedule
* MomentJS -- needed for FullCalendar and is a date API used in other places

Note: The use of FullCalendar requires a Google Developer account, but these are free and there shouldn't be much configuration needed. The API key is supplied in the configuration file. You need a free Google Developer Console account to get a calendar API if the current one is broken.
