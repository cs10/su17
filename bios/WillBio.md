## Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal? 

I was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin up until the 2nd grade, at which point my family made a drastic cross-country move to the tiny desert town of Yuma, Arizona. I stayed there until 6th grade before moving to the agricultural suburbs of Fresno, California, where I attended Clovis West High School. When it came down to it, I was deciding between Cal, Duke University, and Carnegie Mellon, and ultimately Cal was the best choice for educational (and financial) reasons. 

## How much programming have you done (& what languages)?

I actually came into Cal as a purely Pre-Haas (Intended Business Administration) major. But after an incredible experience in CS 10 and the intense peer pressure of my friends, I decided to sacrifice my sanity and sleep, taking on a dual degree in Business Administration and Computer Science. So far, I've programmed in Python, Java, C, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and of course, Snap!

## What are your hobbies?

Tennis, basketball, late-night movies / eating, and perusing sports news or the WSJ

## What are some of your talents & skills? 

Growing up, I practiced Kenpo Karate for several years. I also was an avid thumb-wrestler back in the day. 

## Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you? 

In middle school, I created a small unofficial, commercial for Barnes & Noble that required me to speak in a British accent. It ended up winning an award in a film festival despite its poor quality. I also occasionally give talks on campus on the intersection of science and faith. 

## What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester? 

Business & CS classes, teaching, research, church, and avid eating.
