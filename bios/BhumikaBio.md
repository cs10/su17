## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Chandigarh, a beautiful city right in the foothills of the Himalayas in India. I did my A Levels from Singapore and applied to Cal hoping to do mathematics and/or public health!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I had very little experience in programming before coming to Cal. CS10 was my first proper programming course, and enough to convince me to pursue CS. I have programmed in Snap! (of course), Python, Java, C++ and React.js (not really a programming language but oh well).

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I love dancing; I trained to be a professional for a good number of years, both Indian and Western styles.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

Dance, particularly hip-hop and salsa; I can imitate characters from some movies quite well (I think!); I am also a trained debater and adjudicator in the WSDC format.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I regulated a traffic jam with my friends once, when I was 14!

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

CS70, being a reader for CS10 and my internship.
