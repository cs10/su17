## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Lake Arrowhead (yes, as in Arrowhead Water), a small town in the mountains of SoCal. It’s a lovely town, with an amusing, slightly toxic culture where mountain folk derisively refer to people from down-the-hill as “flatlanders.” Graduated Rim of the World High School (not as cool as the name suggests) and moved up to Berkeley.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I came to Berkeley without a clue of what I wanted to major in, but CS10 convinced me that Computer Science was pretty darn great. I’m now a 4th year CS major, Education minor. I'm competent in Snap!, Python, Java, and C. I'm familiar with SQL and Javascript. Java is my favorite; object-oriented programming can be so satisfyingly slick.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

Games! Board, card, and video. Favorite board and card games are Puerto Rico, Terra Mystica, and Dominion. Favorite video games series are Mass Effect, Dishonored, and Borderlands. Currently I’m spending too much time playing Overwatch, with which I'm making the transition from console to PC. 

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

It’s not exactly a talent, but I type on a Colemak keyboard instead of Qwerty. If you see me peck at a Qwerty keyboard with three fingers, that’s why.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

My family really likes to travel, so I have been to over a dozen countries. In the summer before my sophomore year of high school, I spent two months in France living with my mother’s side of the family, who are French. I still don’t speak French though. My family thinks I wasted that trip, they're probably not wrong.  

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

I am remarkably free this semester, but the classes I’m taking are CS161 (Security), Biology for Voters, and Wealth and Poverty.
