## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. My parents and I moved to San Jose, CA, when I was about three years old. I grew up in San Jose, and came to Cal as a freshman in 2013. This past May, I graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Economics. This coming August, I will be re-enrolling as a masters student under Professor Dan Garcia. Yes, there is a non-zero probability that I will stay at Cal forever... :D

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

My first ever experience programming was in CS10 in Spring 2014. There, I learned Snap! and a bit of python, and fell in love with computer science. Since then, I switched over to the CS major and have done two technical internships. For the most part, I’ve worked with Snap!, python, java, and C. I think it’s fun to learn new programming languages—in many ways it is not too different from learning new spoken languages! It’s all about expressing the same ideas but in different ways.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I enjoy practicing yoga, hiking, camping, traveling, dancing, cooking, and playing with my little sister.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

My first spoken language was Hebrew. At home, I speak Hebrish (an English-Hebrew hybrid) with my family. I also know a bit of Spanish, as I learned it for six years in school and have a friend in Spain who I visit occasionally.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I ran my first half marathon last November! #BerkeleyHalf2016. And I will be running my second one this coming July in San Francisco. 


## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
This summer I am lecturing for CS10!! Besides that, I am also interning in the infrastructure department at Salesforce in San Francisco.
