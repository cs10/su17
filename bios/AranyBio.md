## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

So I was born in Canada (yes, yes, let the Canadian jokes begin), and have spent most of my life in American suburbia since. I’ve lived in the East Bay for a while now, but didn’t think I would go to school so close to home. Now I couldn’t fathom being anywhere else.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I first learned to program in CS10, my first semester here! Since then, I’ve written code in Python, and a little Java. I haven’t taken programming classes since my interests shifted to medicine a few years ago, but I’ve been unable to escape the gravitational pull of CS10.  

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

Writing, singing, meditating, and dancing

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I can do a decent Elmo impression (“I can no longer sleep at night”- anyone who has heard it), and I love making parodies of songs. 

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I’ve been working on a fiction novel about the plight of Tamil refugees in Sri Lanka, and it’s been a long process. If you ever need a favor from me, a good way to make me feel guilty is to ask how my book is going. 

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

Classes, teaching, research, writing, and continuing my secret life as a professional frat star in Delta Phi Epsilon
