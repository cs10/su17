## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Chino Hills, a suburb in Southern California about 1 hour east of Los Angeles. I went to International Polytechnic High School (the name is fancy, but the school is not) a small college prep High School on the campus of Cal-Poly Pomona. There I was able to take college classes in High School. I applied to a lot of UCs as I planned to stay in California and ended up getting into CAL!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I came into Berkeley intending to major in Linguistics and had no prior programming experience. CS10 was the first class I took here at CAL. I fell in love with the course and Computer Science. I am now a double majoring Linguistics and Computer Science. I have programmed in Snap!, python, java, C and some other languages. My favorite Language is Snap!
