## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. I’m from a town called Del Mar (near UCSD). I played on my high school’s (Canyon Crest Academy) basketball team. Basketball was and is one of my biggest passions along with CS of course! In terms of colleges, it came down to deciding between Gonzaga University and Cal, and I decided that I had to give Cal a shot and so here I am.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I came into Cal with basically no programming experience. I took CS 10 my first semester and it convinced me to keep going on to take the rest of the CS classes here. CS 10 is definitely in my top 3 favorite classes I’ve taken here. I’ve programmed in Python, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Objective-C and I have done development with Android and iOS as well.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
Playing basketball, watching basketball, playing NBA 2K.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS

I have a pretty good Batman voice.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I took a trip to Ireland in the Summer where I had Guinness and Murphy’s in Dublin and Cork (where each of those beers originally comes from, respectively).

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

CS 162 and EE16A, teaching, applying for real-people jobs after college, going to ALL of the Cal basketball games and boba.
