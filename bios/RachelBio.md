## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Orinda, CA (over the hills/through the Caldecott Tunnel)
 so I'm born and bred from the East Bay. I did not intend to come to Cal,
  but then I did... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

Technically, in 7th grade I created my a website using HTML (it was on Broadway
 musicals); but at the time didn't realize that was programming...so I don't
 really count it. That aside, I didn't take up computer science until CS10,
 learning BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks, the previous iteration of Snap!).
 After that there's been a hodgepodge of Python, Java, C, MIPS, Ruby, etc.
 throughout these four and a half years (most of which I have not retained as
 well as I probably should). This will be the first semester I am not taking a
 CS class, so no programming for me this fall.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I like reading, occasionally writing, napping, and cuddling with dogs (but in
 reality, mostly it's staring at dogs from afar so as to not creep out the owner).

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I can make a clover with my tongue, I memorize Broadway musicals pretty
well, and I listen well?

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I finished writing two novels in 6th and 7th grade, and then I walked part
of the Great Wall of China in 8th. I kind of peaked early.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

Classes, answering emails, and worrying about that real life that I will
have to face come December.
