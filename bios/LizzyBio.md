## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I was born and raised in Southern California. I’m not very adventurous, so I was pretty sure I wanted to go to school somewhere in the state. Berkeley happened to be a great choice and opportunity.


## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I never programmed before CS10, I decided to take it just to try it out. Luckily I fell in love with computer science and found something I wanted to study here, so since taking the class I’ve programmed in Python, Java, C, Ruby, and various others to lesser extents.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I really enjoy playing racquetball with the club here at Berkeley, reading fiction, watching TV (that’s a hobby, right?), playing video games (definitely a hobby), and cooking/baking.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I am adequate at a variety of arts and crafts like drawing, painting, origami, and knitting. I am a big fan of music and love to play any instrument I can get my hands on like the piano, guitar, or ukulele, much to the chagrin of my neighbors.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

Nah.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

CS10, other (less important) classes, running between campus and home to take care of my cat and dog, and playing racquetball.
