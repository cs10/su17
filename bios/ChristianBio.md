## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

Christian was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. When he graduated high school he initially wanted to do something related to Media and he never seriously considered pursuing a career in anything like CS since back then he couldn't program a potato to grow mold, much less a computer  (plus he kind of really hated math). So the truth is that he came to Berkeley wanting to be a filmmaker or something but then he took CS10 and was fooled...I mean hooked; he is now one of the many proud masochists trying to graduate with a Computer Science degree from Berkeley, go him, right? All jokes aside CS is a really amazing field and CS10 is definitely the best place to get started, and I'm not getting payed to say that...Well I guess I do work for CS10 but that's beyond the point.

## WHAT DO YOU DO ON YOUR FREE TIME?

Free time...HA! Christian takes great pleasure in browsing Youtube and Netflix in medically-irresponsible positions. He also really likes learning languages; so far he speaks English, Spanish and Italian. He says he's also learning Mandarin and Portuguese so if you speak any of these, please do check to see if it's true.
